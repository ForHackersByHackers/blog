Welcome! My goal for this blog is to document my thoughts and the things I learn to make them available
for others with similar interests, and for my own personal reference. Along the 
way I plan to cover various topics in the fields of cybersecurity, as well as some of my other personal
interests just for flavor. A little about myself. I love all things relating to the flows of information
both digital and physical. I am a huge advocate for digital privacy and opponent of all forms 
of censorship. I am always looking to further my knowledge of the world around me and the 
methods humans and computers use to store, share, and process data. You can expect much of that in posts to come.
Aside from that I always enjoy some gaming with buddies and may even chronical some of that here as well. 
With that said I invite you to join me on my quest to pwn the web. Thanks for visiting.
