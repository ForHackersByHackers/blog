Dear Reader,

ForHackersByHackers is exactly that. A place for research and the exchange of information in the field of cybersecurity. The goal of this blog is to help document the techniques and methodology regarding the many areas of cybersecurity in one neatly organized space. I hope for this to become a reliable source of curated resources and tools to advance ones understanding and practice of these principles. Additionally I hope this space can help the average user and those less involved understand some of the many pitfalls and weaknesses in what has become an integral part of our everyday lives.  

Yours Truly,

BugcatcherNade
